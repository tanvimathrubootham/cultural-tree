        <h2>Aboriginal Australian Dot Painting (Roots)</h2>
        <p>Aboriginal Australian dot painting functions as a visual language grounded in ancestry, land, and collective memory. Traditionally used to encode Dreamtime stories, kinship systems, and sacred geography, the repetition of dots and concentric circles reflects continuity across generations. Rather than centering individual authorship, the art communicates relational belonging; the self is understood as part of an inherited network of land, story, and community. Within Cultural Psychology, this art form reflects an interdependent model of self-construal, in which identity is embedded within enduring social, relational, and ecological systems. The absence of a singular focal point visually reinforces that the self is not autonomous but networked within community and ancestral history.</p>
        <p>Placed in the roots of the tree, this tradition symbolizes the foundational layer of identity. Just as roots anchor a tree to the soil, ancestral memory and collective belonging anchor the self. The dotted pathways visually resemble underground networks, suggesting that identity is nourished by invisible yet deeply embedded cultural ties. The roots serve as a reminder that the self does not emerge in isolation, but rather grows from inherited structures of meaning.</p>

        <h2>Islamic Geometric Art (Trunk)</h2>
        <p>Islamic geometric art is characterized by intricate tessellations, symmetry, and mathematical precision. Historically, it developed within religious and philosophical contexts that emphasized divine unity and the infinite nature of creation. The patterns often avoid figurative representation, instead directing attention toward order, harmony, and transcendence beyond individual ego. Within Cultural Psychology, this art form aligns with an interdependent orientation rooted in collective and spiritual frameworks, reflecting a model of identity shaped by structure and larger systems. The repetition of geometric forms conveys stability and continuity, suggesting that meaning emerges from alignment with universal principles rather than personal expression.</p>
        <p>Placed in the trunk of the tree, the geometric structure represents stability and cohesion. The trunk holds the entire organism upright, just as cultural systems provide structure to identity. The repetition of pattern within the trunk suggests that identity is sustained by shared frameworks and collective principles. In this position, the trunk becomes a metaphor for cultural architecture, the structural core through which both interdependence and expression are supported.</p>

    <div id="sumi-content" class="section-content">
        <h2>Japanese Sumi-e Ink Painting (Left Branches)</h2>
        <p>Japanese sumi-e ink painting emphasizes minimalism, restraint, and intentionality. The use of negative space is as meaningful as the ink itself, reflecting aesthetic philosophies rooted in Zen Buddhism, impermanence, and harmony with nature. Each brushstroke carries emotional weight, yet remains controlled and economical. Within Cultural Psychology, this art form visually encodes an orientation toward context sensitivity and relational harmony. The restrained composition reflects an interdependent understanding of the self that prioritizes balance, situational awareness, and emotional moderation. Unlike expressive traditions that foreground individuality, sumi-e communicates that identity exists in relation to surrounding space.</p>
        <p>Placed along the left branches of the tree, sumi-e represents the subtle extension of identity into relational environments. Branches reach outward carefully, adapting to space and light. The visible brushstrokes mirror how identity can extend into the world while remaining balanced and attuned. The negative space between branches reflects the importance of context, suggesting that individuals are shaped by the spaces they inhabit.</p>

        <h2>American Abstract Expressionism (Right Canopy)</h2>
        <p>American Abstract Expressionism is a movement that foregrounds spontaneity, personal emotion, and visible authorship. Through dynamic brushstrokes and layered color, artists place an emphasis on individuality and psychological depth. The canvas becomes a site of autonomous expression rather than collective preservation. Within Cultural Psychology, this art form reflects an independent self-construal, where identity is defined by autonomy, personal emotion, and self-expression. In contrast to the structured or relational traditions represented elsewhere in the tree, this section emphasizes freedom and subjective meaning-making.</p>
        <p>Placed in the right canopy of the tree, this section symbolizes outward growth and visibility. The canopy is what the world sees; it is expansive, expressive, and reaching toward open space. Just as leaves capture light, independent self-expression seeks recognition and affirmation. The swirling motion of color reflects how autonomy expands identity outward, allowing it to occupy space boldly.</p>
